## Description
In this weeks challenge I was tasked to make a quiz on javascript. During the challenge I added classes and Id's to the HTML so I could later select them in the javascript tag. I made up a various questions and with that multiple choice when it came to the answers. When you select any anwer you are given a notice if it is correct or incorrect. After that you will be able to click on the next button for next set of questions and answer choices. 

This project is not yet complete. It is still a work in progress.
